NX is added to help with tasks and caching.

## ðŸ’» Development

Install dependencies with `pnpm install`.

### Running workspace projects

To run a workspace project, you can still use the normal pnpm commands.
To incorporate NX in the process, run commands using nx instead.

```sh
npx nx serve <project>
```

## ðŸ§° Tasks
